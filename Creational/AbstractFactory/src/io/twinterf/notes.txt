Concepts:
factory of factories
factory of related objects
shares a common interface
defers to a subclass
very common in frameworks

Design Considerations:
group a collection of factories together
factory is still responsible for lifecycle itself
has common interface
concrete classes that are returned from factory
parameterized
built using composition

Pitfalls:
Complexity
runtime switch, client can have some degree of influence
pattern within a pattern
problem specific
starts off as a factory and then gets refactored into abstract factory

Summary:
group of similar factories
complex
heavily abstracted
technically a framework pattern, usually built as part of larger framework inside of our code
